# Simple dictionary API with Oxford Dictionary integration.

### What about the project?
The simple REST API with the simple idea â€“ get info about the requested word.
By request for info about a word, it refers to Oxford Dictionary data, saves it into DynamoDB to decrease
the count of requests to the external resource, and returns processed data.
Uses DynamoDB as the main database and Redis for caching.

P.S. That's my first project on Golang, so will be so proud of your comments and piece of advice about the 
improvements!
